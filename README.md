## Project Description
Prof-alytics is a revolutionary Ed-Tech platform built for the "Useless Hackathon." It uses a browser-native AI to analyze an instructor's facial expressions from a video, providing the first-ever quantifiable metric for classroom happiness: the Smile Count. Our platform visualizes the AI's findings in real-time, turning a subjective feeling into hard, useless data.

### The Problem
For decades, university administrators have been flying blind, relying on subjective metrics like "student feedback" and "exam results." They have no real, hard data on the most crucial KPI of all: is the professor actually happy to be there? This leads to a crisis of unquantified sentiment and suboptimal faculty morale.

### The Solution
Prof-alytics provides a robust, data-driven solution. By leveraging a sophisticated, browser-native AI engine, our platform analyzes an instructor's facial expressions in real-time, providing the first-ever quantifiable metric for classroom happiness: the Smile Count. Now, for the first time, we can attach KPIs to joy.
