## Project Description

Prof-alytics is a revolutionary Ed-Tech platform. It addresses the critical, unaddressed problem in modern education: the inability to quantify an instructor's happiness in real-time.

### The Problem
For too long, universities have relied on subjective student feedback. Our platform provides a data-driven solution.

### The Solution
Using a sophisticated AI engine to analyze a video feed and provide the first-ever KPI for classroom engagement: the Smile Count.

#### Installation

1. **Clone the repo (or download the files):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git
   ```
2. **Download the AI models:**  
   Ensure the `weights` folder from face-api.js is in the root of your project directory.

#### Run

- Run with a Local Server. This project must be run from a local server to avoid browser security (CORS) errors.
